1) From serial no 1 to 72, are all the calls done ?
2) From serial no 100 to 133, are all the calls done ?
3) For column Mock Test(Y/N), mark Y or N.
   Don't leave it blank.

4) Why the status column is blank ?
   In CRM Process there are 5 steps
		Steps						Status
		-------						--------
	a) Generate Brand Awarness				--> Initial
	b) Acquire Leads					--> Potential 
	c) Convert Leads into Customers				--> Customer
	d) Provide Superior Support (Existing Customer)		--> Support
	e) Drive Upsells and Referrals  (Existing Customer)	--> Upsells
	
	In addition to above statuses there can be 2 more statuses.

	If any prospect rejects then in status column mark as Reject.
	
	If any prospect do not pick your call or Busy then in status column mark as Not-PickedUp.
	For Not-PickedUp we need to call the prospect till we are sure about his/her status. 

   	In the status column fill any one of the above status for each row.

	We need to analyze the prospect on the basis of status column.
		
5) If the content of remarks column is too long write in comment.
   Use the comment feature in excel.

6) Rename the column Date as Visit Date.
	If the column is blank just put a default value 01-09-2023.
	Don't leave it blank.

7) Beside the Visit Date column make another column as Enquiry Date.
	Enquiry Date will be blank for those prospects whom we did not contacted.
